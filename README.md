# Turzx Themes (5")

These are themes for the 5" variant of the WOWNOVA Turzx Turing Smart Screen internal PC display monitor. It's a collection of all themes, plus all the custom themes found on Turzx's website, provided by users and Turzx themselves. This will serve as a repository that will be updated randomly with the newest themes publicly available that I find. Because the original Turzx website is mostly Chinese, confusing, and slow for many, I figured this would be a great way to compile everything in one easy place for English-speaking users who have trouble accessing the Turzx website. 

# Currently Included (01-21-2025)
- 199 theme files.
- 44 image files to create themes.
- 29 UI images to help create themes.

*All credit goes to the original creators.
I do not own the program, nor have I made most themes.*
